        <ul>
          <li>The Rosylee has a great set menu available Monday to Sundays which include 2 courses for £11.95 or 3 courses for £14.95. They also do a cracking Brunch.
            <a href="http://rosylee.com/menu/">Click here to see their menu</a></li>
            <li>For all things cheese check out Northern Soul Grilled cheese, we'd recommend trying the mac attack if you are feeling brave!
